WP Mercado Libre Sync will connect your website with the Mercado Libre API in 2 steps.

== Description ==

This plugin will make possible to interact with your application on Mercado Libre using their API. Once this is done, plugin will ensure to keep conected allways, refreshing tokens when necesary.

Since from there all the rest is just how to use the API, more modules will be opened to add into the plugin´s functionality. By default plugin has the "Shortcodes" module included, that´s is a large variety of shortcodes to output into the front-end, like your products by category, or by date, or by price, or just a single product by ID, user information, comments, so on. All those things will be the ones used on your Mercado Libre publications. The basic module will do just basic things, there will be other modules for real syncronization between your publications on ML, and your post on WP.

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
